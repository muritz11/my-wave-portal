# Basic Web3 Project

Wave portal is a simple web3 app where you can wave at me and send me a message built with Solidity, Hardhat for setting up local ethereum network, Reactjs for the client-side. Deployed smart contract on rinkeby test network.


Thanks to buildspace awesome course, I have been able to:
  - Create and deploy my first smart contract
  - Build a 'Connect Wallet' flow
  - Store data and user message on blockchain
  - Client-side interacting with contract

You can connect your wallet, send a message and wave at me using the link below:
